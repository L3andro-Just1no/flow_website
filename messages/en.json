      "title": "Where Flow",
      "titleHighlight": "Began",
      "paragraph1": "It all started in 2019, with Flow Productions emerging as a studio passionate about 2D animation and motion graphics. At that time, our flow ran in only one direction: bringing images to life.",
      "paragraph2": "With out-of-the-box video and animation productions, Flow quickly stood out for quality and rigor. But, like everything that flows, we also evolved. We realized early on that clients weren't just looking for an isolated service: they wanted proximity, personalization and complete communication experiences.",
      "paragraph3": "It was from this energy that the transformation was born. From an animation studio, we became a multidisciplinary creative agency in the Algarve, where design, marketing, audiovisual and animation intersect in a continuous flow.",
      "paragraph4": "In 2022, we reinforced this identity with three pillars that define us to this day: rigor, innovation and people.",
      "paragraph5": "Today, our projects have in their DNA a current made of strategy, personalization, creativity and know-how. Our mission remains clear: to unite brands and people through the energy of communication and create stories that never stop flowing."
